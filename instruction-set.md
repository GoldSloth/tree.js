## Instructions
*For this algorithm you need to define three things:*

1. An axiom (A string that determines n0)
2. A set of rules for each iteration. Example:
	* A -> B
	* B -> AB
3. ***Optional*** Probability of angle change for "randomising" plant growth

### Instruction set
	
* 1 rotateX +
* 2 rotateX -
* 3 rotateY +
* 4 rotateY -
* 5 rotateZ +
* 6 rotateY -

* F Forward

* [ Start branch
* ] Close branch
